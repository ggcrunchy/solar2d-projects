# solar2d-projects
Code for miscellaneous [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com) projects.

At the moment this is for snapshots of code discussed [on streams](https://www.twitch.tv/ggcrunchy). At the moment, these are also archived [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgI4xMfkCIo4rBFHfAHR6sA).

The **libtess2** and **msquares** samples discussed on the test stream are currently available [here](https://github.com/ggcrunchy/corona-plugin-docs/tree/master/libtess2_sample) and
[here](https://github.com/ggcrunchy/corona-plugin-docs/tree/master/msquares_sample) respectively.

The shader tests may presently be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/ggcrunchy/corona_shader_tests), although I'll see about freeze-framing that with all submodules.
